AFAsyncNetworking
=================

A collection of wrapper adapter classes that integrate [AFNetworking](https://github.com/iAsync/AFNetworking) with [iAsync](https://github.com/EmbeddedSources/iAsync/) library.

**Note:** We use a fork of AFNetworking since @mattt does not accept pull requests with a static library target.
